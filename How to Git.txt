Hello guys!


How to git.


Publishing Changes.

Whenever you make a change to the folder that Git is tracking, it will keep track of changes and update a log file that allows people to see what changes have been made.
This allows us to have a history of the repository.


1) Make some changes to whatever you want.

2) Stage the changes for commit 

git add <full filepath>

3) Commit the changes. This commit the changes to the log.

git commit -m "<write a commit message>"

4) ALWAYS ALWAYS PULL before you push. When you pull, you bring in everyone elses changes before publishing your own.
   If you do not pull and you push directly, you will overwrite other people's changes and lose other people's work.
   
   git pull
   
5) Push to the master repository after you fix merges and stuff.

    git push
	
6) YAY
